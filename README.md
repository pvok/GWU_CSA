CSCI 6461 CSA Project

The project's goal is to create an assembly language-based simulator of a modest traditional CISC computer. The project's first phase will have the following features:
• 4 General Purpose Registers (GPRs) – each 16 bits in length [GPR0, GPR1, GPR2, GPR3]
• 3 Index Registers – 16 bits in length [IXR1, IXR2, IXR3]
• 16-bit words
• Memory of 2048 words, expandable to 4096 words
• Word addressable
